Here are some notes:

* day 1: not so hard but some corner cases.
  I used Python because that what I'm the most confortable with.
  I rewrote the part 1 in go for fun.

* day 2: trying to do it in go (and not python).
  I had the intuition about the regex for the p1, but the golang regex engine
  does not accept `\1`, so I did it another way.
  It turns out I was on the correct path and the p2 is way easier with a regex.
  I used Perl for that.
  I really struggle to write Perl now (compared to 12 years ago), but the regex
  engine is just so powerful.
  Implicit variables and implicit type conversion also made the code very compact,
  which is nice when writing but terrible when reading (and the implicite type
  conversion is a potential source of error).
