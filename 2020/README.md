# aoc_2020

Learnt this year:
* how to implement an Iterator
* Array.product
* Iterator.step
* Number.step
* Comparable
* `'a'..'z'` is possible
* iterators are faster than manipulating (even small) arrays
* creating a new Set is faster than `#uniq`
* editing an hash inplace is faster than creating a new one (`select` vs `select!`)
